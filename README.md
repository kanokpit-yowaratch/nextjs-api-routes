## Next.js API Routes

The examples in this project demonstrate how to create different types of APIs in Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Main point

Next.js can create API routes in 2 places:
1. In app directory
2. In pages directory


There are at least four differences between the 2 methods:
1. Folder placement and File naming
2. Function name
3. Request
4. Response
